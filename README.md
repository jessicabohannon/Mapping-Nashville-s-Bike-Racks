## Nashville Bike Rack Mapping

### Description:
This project explores the spatial distribution of bike racks in Nashville, Tennessee, using Geopandas and Folium for geospatial analysis and visualization. By mapping bike rack locations across different zip code areas, the project aims to provide insights into cycling infrastructure accessibility and promote sustainable transportation options in the city.

### Skills Used:
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Utilized Geopandas to work with geographical data and conduct spatial operations.
* **Data Visualization:** Created interactive maps using Folium to visualize bike rack locations and distribution.
* **Data Wrangling:** Processed and prepared bike rack data for analysis and visualization.
* **Python Programming:** Leveraged Python programming skills to manipulate data and create visualizations.
